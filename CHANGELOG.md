# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.4.3-Lite] - 2026-01-08
### Added
- **Lite Branch Created:** A lightweight version of the script that removes the dependency on MKVToolNix.
- **Pure Automation:** Focuses strictly on starting, stopping, and renaming recordings based on combat events without injecting chapter markers.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-01-04
### Changed
- **✨ Better Death Tracking:** Implemented GUID-based filtering (`Player-` prefix) to prevent NPCs like "War-God Jalak" or "Mature Egg of Ji-Kun" from appearing as player deaths.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-01-04
### Changed
- **🎨 Refined UI Layout:** Initialization sequence reordered for maximum clarity.
- **🏷️ Independent Expansion Labeling:** The game version (e.g., "World of Warcraft Classic") now appears on its own line for a more professional dashboard feel.
- **✨ Simplified Status Prompt:** Cleaned up the final `MONITORING ACTIVE` line by removing redundant tags.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-01-03
### Added
- **🎯 Expansion-Agnostic Results:** Re-engineered the `ENCOUNTER_END` logic to use end-anchored regex. This prevents the script from misidentifying "Group Size" or "Difficulty ID" as the success bit in MoP Classic where field counts vary between bosses.
- **🛡️ Recording Overlap Protection:** Added an `is_finalizing` state gate. This prevents a new recording from starting while the previous clip is still in the 5-second post-kill finalization window, avoiding potential file handle conflicts or crashes.

### Changed
- **⚙️ Strict ID Matching:** The script now pairs `ENCOUNTER_START` and `ENCOUNTER_END` by their unique numeric ID. This ensures multi-phase encounters (like Iron Qon) do not trigger multiple recording events when sub-bosses or mounts die.
- **⚡ Performance Optimization:** Combined state locks and reduced sleep-timer overhead (from 0.1s to 0.01s) to ensure the script catches events with millisecond precision during heavy combat.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-01-03
### Added
- **🏆 M+ Support:** Support for Mythic+ (Retail) and MoP-style Challenge Modes.
- **🔑 M+ Key Level Detection:** Filenames now automatically extract and include the specific key level (e.g., `+15`) from the combat log.
- **📍 Nested Boss Chapters:** While recording a dungeon run, the script now injects sub-chapters for every individual boss pull and result.
- **🛡️ Stability Fixes:** Implemented a file-handle retry loop to prevent `PermissionError` during muxing/renaming.
- **💻 Refined UI:** Updated the launcher with expansion detection (RETAIL vs CLASSIC) and improved folder path troubleshooting.
- **🌟 Universal Expansion Support:** Updated core regex to ensure compatibility with **Retail**, **Classic (Cata/MoP)**, and **TBC Anniversary** servers.
- **🌍 Global Name Handling:** Support for all global naming formats (`Name-Realm`) across all regions.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-02
### Added
- **🎨 ANSI Color Coding:** The console now uses colors for better readability (Green = Success, Red = Death, Cyan = Recording).
- **🖥️ Terminal UI Improvements:** Cleaned up the log output to be more professional and scannable.
- **✨ README Preview:** Added a console output example to the documentation.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-12-28
### Added
- **🚀 Initial Stable Release:** Official launch featuring auto-recording, boss-based renaming, and basic death chaptering.
